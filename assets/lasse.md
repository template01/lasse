Hi,
I’m <span data-target="lasse">Lasse</span>. I love building stuff. Online and offline. I’m a trained graphic designer, self-taught web-developer and I grew up on a <span data-target="farm">farm</span>.

I’ve worked for clients such as <span data-target="connectit">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</span>, <span data-target="lasse">Willem De Kooning Academy</span>, <span data-target="editthispost">Domein voor Kunstkritiek</span>, <span data-target="pop">Het Nieuwe Instituut</span> and others.


<!-- Strong communication with clients and colleagues is super important to me; it allows for a smooth process and a varied working environment. -->

I’m good at imagining and visualizing concepts whether that might be through <span data-target="lasse">sketches, prototypes or models</span>.

Professionally I’ve mainly worked as a webdesigner and developer, but I’m really interested in projects which touch upon product design, webdesign and automation. The transition between <span data-target="lasse">digital and analog</span> really get’s me started.

I believe in <span data-target="lasse">a connected web</span>. A website not only talks to a visitor but also communicates with your fridge and your smartphone. I therefore also believe in the importance and the rise of flexible Content Management Systems built around <span data-target="lasse">REST-API/GraphQl</span> or other query languages.
